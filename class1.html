      goes into making a website attractive<br> and

       of front-end development, 
      and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
      </p>
      <p>

            <h4>Commenting</h4>
            <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is<br>
                often ignored by programmers, especially<br>
                  for codes that are written by multiple <br>
                  programmers. But remember, commenting <br>
                  is an important part of project you create. <br>
                  With proper comments and organised files its<br>
                   always easier for you or others to jump in and<br>
                    understand where things are at and how they work.<br>
            </p>

            <h4>Invest in Productve Tool</h4> 
            <p>
                The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools,<br>
                 from browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices <br>
                 available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really<br> 
                 productive web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end <br>
                 designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub,<br>
                  Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.<br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Always Be Curious</h4>
        <p>
            A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself <br>
            updated continuously with the latest news and <br>
            innovations in the field. You need to take a<br>
             proactive stand and learn new things about <br>
             front-end development from informative blogs<br>
              and videos. Following are some of the most<br>
               informative and useful learning sources for <br>
               front-end developers -

                <li>CSS Weekly Focus</li>

            <h4> Refactor Your Code From Time to time</h4>
            <p>
                By “refactoring” your code, you’re only <br>
                enhancing the code without tampering with<br>
                 its functionality. This will improve the<br>
                  quality and readability quotient of your<br>
                   code and the more often you do it, your<br>
                    code will continually be updated into<br> 
                    a cleaner and fresher version of what <br>
                    it was before. Apart from that, one of<br>
                the most significant advantages that refactoring<br>
            offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.<br>

            <h4>Automate</h4>
            <p>
                As a front-end developer, you already<br>
                 have to take care of minute little details <br>
                 that can get overwhelming at times. You have
                  to invest your time on things like Boilerplate,<br>
                   testing, workflow, dependency management,<br>
                    performance, optimization, build, deployment,<br>
                     and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?<br>
                     Take some steam off yourself and incorporate <br>
                    automationinto yourworkflow. While automation<br> 
                    can take care of things such as optimization, <br>
                    testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas<br>
                     of front-end development such as HTML, CSS, <br>
                     creating the client-side software, enhancing<br> 
                     the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, <br>
                     not only will your productivity increase, but<br>
                      you will also learn to use your time to focus<br>
                      on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality<br>
                       of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very<br>
                        efficient automation tools.While these tips will <br>
                        surely help you become a better front-end designer,<br>
